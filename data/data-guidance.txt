Pupil attendance in schools
2023 Week 29

Rounding

In recognition of the uncertainty around inset days, reporting lag and reduced response rate, rates for week commencing 5 September 2022 have been rounded to 0 decimal places.

All other figures are unrounded.

Data suppression

Where there is only 1 school in a local authority at daily, weekly, termly or year to date level, the attendance figures are suppressed.

All other figures are unsuppressed.

Footnotes:

1. At local authority level, due to data only being representative of those schools currently participating in daily data sharing, it is possible there will be differences between absence rates presented here and in the termly school census based absence publication. 
2. For pupils in special schools, there are a very small number of enrolments with No SEN or on SEN support and care should be taken when using these figures in particular. As there is a difference in timeliness between this publication and data produced from the school census, it is possible there will be differences between the absence rates presented here and in the census absence publication.

Footnotes:

1. At local authority level, due to data only being representative of those schools currently participating in daily data sharing, it is possible there will be differences between absence rates presented here and in the termly school census based absence publication. 
2. For pupils in special schools, there are a very small number of enrolments with No SEN or on SEN support and care should be taken when using these figures in particular. As there is a difference in timeliness between this publication and data produced from the school census, it is possible there will be differences between the absence rates presented here and in the census absence publication.

Footnotes:

1. Absence refers to children who are absent for authorised and unauthorised reasons, this includes children who are absent with a positive COVID case, but does not include children who are isolating but have not had a confirmed positive case, e.g. as a contact.
2. COVID non-attendance refers to children who are not attending school due to public health guidelines. For the autumn term 2021, this should mostly have been used to record where a pupil was absent from school with symptoms of COVID-19 whilst awaiting the results of a test or as a contact. This differs to previous terms when this code was also used where pupils were advised to shield, were quarantining after returning from abroad, or were in class bubbles advised to isolate. In these circumstances schools are expected to provide remote education.
3. 31.6% and 8.7% relate to the additional pupils when COVID non-attendance is included. Some of these pupils will have reached 10% or more by a combination of COVID non-attendance and absence.
